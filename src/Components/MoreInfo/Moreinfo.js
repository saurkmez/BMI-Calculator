        Adolphe Quetelet, a Belgian astronomer, mathematician, statistician, and
        sociologist, devised the basis of the BMI between 1830 and 1850 as he
        developed what he called "social physics". The modern term "body mass
        index" (BMI) for the ratio of human body weight to squared height was
        coined in a paper published in the July 1972 edition of the Journal of
        Chronic Diseases by Ancel Keys and others. In this paper, Keys argued
        that what he termed the BMI was "...if not fully satisfactory, at least
        as good as any other relative weight index as an indicator of relative
        obesity". The interest in an index that measures body fat came with
        observed increasing obesity in prosperous Western societies. Keys
        explicitly judged BMI as appropriate for population studies and
        inappropriate for individual evaluation. Nevertheless, due to its
        simplicity, it has come to be widely used for preliminary diagnoses.
        Additional metrics, such as waist circumference, can be more useful. The
        BMI is universally expressed in kg/m2, resulting from mass in kilograms
        and height in metres. If pounds and inches are used, a conversion factor
        of 703 (kg/m2)/(lb/in2) must be applied. When the term BMI is used
        informally, the units are usually omitted. BMI provides a simple numeric
        measure of a person's thickness or thinness, allowing health
        professionals to discuss weight problems more objectively with their
        patients. BMI was designed to be used as a simple means of classifying
        average sedentary (physically inactive) populations, with an average
        body composition.[9] For such individuals, the value recommendations as
        of 2014 are as follows: a BMI from 18.5 up to 25 kg/m2 may indicate
        optimal weight, a BMI lower than 18.5 suggests the person is
        underweight, a number from 25 up to 30 may indicate the person is
        overweight, and a number from 30 upwards suggests the person is obese.
        Lean male athletes often have a high muscle-to-fat ratio and therefore a
        BMI that is misleadingly high relative to their body-fat percentage.
